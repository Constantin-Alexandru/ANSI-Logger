ANSI Logger
============

ANSI Logger is a logger library that uses [ANSI Lib](https://github.com/Constantin-Alexandru/ANSI-Library)
for formatting.

## Languages supported

The ANSI Logger library has support for multiple languages, with more planned.
Currently, ANSI Logger has support (and planned support) for the following languages:

- [x] [C/C++](https://github.com/Constantin-Alexandru/ANSI-Logger/tree/C-library)
- [x] [Javascript](https://github.com/Constantin-Alexandru/ANSI-Logger/tree/JS-library)
- [ ] Typescript

## How to use

The way to use it differs based on the language.

### C/C++

To use ANSI Logger in any C/C++ project, just download the `ansi_lib.h`
file from the linked project and also download `ansi_logger.h` from this file
add it to your includes folder, and you are up and running.

Due to compatibility reasons for some terminal emulators, the function `setupConsole()`
must be called before utilizing the library.

### Javascript

To use ANSI Logger in any Javascript project, you will need to install it using `npm`
using the following command:

```bash
> npm i logger-ansi 
```

***Note:*** The library will not work for browser terminals.
